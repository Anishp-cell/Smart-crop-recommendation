Smart Crop Recommendation System-
The goal is to develop a data-driven model that optimizes crop selection by analyzing soil and weather conditions. 
This model will use data to determine the most suitable crops for different soil types and weather patterns, aiming to improve crop yield and sustainability. 
By addressing the challenges of matching crops to their ideal growing conditions, the model will support more effective agricultural planning and enhance overall farm productivity
